# Murray

[Murray](https://github.com/synesthesia-it/Murray) is a CLI interface that is mainly used to 
- Clone a project template (Skeleton) from a git repository
- Add pieces of boilerplates (file templates named Bones) to current project to speed up development

Please refer to Murray's documentation for proper usage.

For our main Skeleton, two [Bones](https://gitlab.com/synesthesia_team/mobile/ios/internal/bones) repositories are currently available:

- [MVVM](https://gitlab.com/synesthesia_team/mobile/ios/internal/bones/mvvm), containing bones specifically designed for [Boomerang](https://github.com/synesthesia-it/Boomerang) (new ViewModels, Scenes, Views, etc.)
- [Model](https://gitlab.com/synesthesia_team/mobile/ios/internal/bones/model), containing bones for anything related to **Model** framework (new UseCases, Repositories)
